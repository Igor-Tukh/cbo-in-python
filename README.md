# Consensus-Based Optimization in TensorFlow
## Description
TODO
## Libraries & dependencies
Used libraries are specified in `requirements.txt`. One can install the missing libraries via the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Examples
* Please refer to [`notebooks/torch_cbo_on_mnist.ipynb`](https://github.com/Igor-Tukh/cbo-in-tensorflow/blob/master/notebooks/torch_cbo_on_mnist.ipynb) for details on torch implementation of CBO.
* Please refer to [`notebooks/minimize_pytorch.ipynb`](https://github.com/Igor-Tukh/cbo-in-python/blob/master/notebooks/minimize_pytorch.ipynb) for  examples on functions minimization and visualization via `PyTorch` implementation.
* Please refer to [`notebooks/functions_minimization_examples.ipynb`](https://github.com/Igor-Tukh/cbo-in-tensorflow/blob/master/notebooks/functions_minimization_examples.ipynb) to view examples on functions minimization and visualization via Tensorflow implementation.
* Some experiments on training neural networks via CBO can be found in folder [`notebooks/experiments`](https://github.com/Igor-Tukh/cbo-in-python/tree/master/notebooks/experiments).
## Current TODOs:
* Documentation
* `requirements.txt`
* Refactoring
